    <h2>About Shivam Dairy</h2>
    <p>
      Shivam Dairy is a proud subsidiary of Shree Vareshwar Dudh Dairy (established in 2008), and was founded in 2021 with a vision to bring high-quality, fresh dairy products to local communities. The dairy was established in Jesar, a town in the Bhavnagar district of Gujarat, by Devkubhai Mala and his two dedicated partners.

      
    </p>
    <p>
      Rooted in trust and tradition, Shivam Dairy carries forward the legacy of purity and authenticity. With a strong commitment to quality and customer satisfaction, we strive to deliver farm-fresh, preservative-free milk and dairy products that families can rely on every day.

    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
    <p>
      The story of Shivam Dairy is one of dedication, resilience, and steady growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early days, milk collection began on a small scale, sourcing from around 20 villages in the surrounding areas of Jesar. Like many humble beginnings, the path wasn‚Äôt easy. The team faced major challenges‚Äîmilk would sometimes spoil due to lack of proper storage, and there were days when it had to be sold without any profit. These tough times led to the exit of Devkubhai Mala‚Äôs original partners, leaving him to carry forward the vision of Shree Vareshwar Dudh Dairy on his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      With unwavering determination, Devkubhai continued the work, believing in the values of purity and service. His efforts gradually bore fruit. What once started with just 200‚Äì300 liters of milk per day has now grown into a flourishing business, collecting over 30,000 liters daily from more than 100 villages.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the business grew, so did the dream. In 2021, Shivam Dairy was launched as a subsidiary of Vareshwar Dairy. It marked a new chapter‚Äîfocusing not just on collection, but also on processing and packaging dairy products like milk, buttermilk, ghee, curd, and paneer under the Shivam Dairy brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Shivam Dairy stands as a symbol of perseverance and quality, delivering trusted dairy products while supporting the livelihoods of hundreds of village farmers.
